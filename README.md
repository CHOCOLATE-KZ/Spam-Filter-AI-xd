# SpamFilterAI
Spam Filter AI is a project in Python that uses machine learning to detect spam emails. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Naive Bayes classification. The program reads email content, converts it into useful data with TF-IDF vectorization, and then decides if the email is spam or not, keeping your inbox clean and organized.
