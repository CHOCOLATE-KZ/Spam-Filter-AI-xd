# Spam Filter AI

Spam Filter AI is a Python application designed to classify emails as spam or non-spam using machine learning techniques. By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Naive Bayes classification, this tool helps maintain an organized and spam-free inbox.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Spam Filter AI employs advanced machine learning methods to process and analyze email content, categorizing it as spam or non-spam. Key components include:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For analyzing and understanding text.
- **Naive Bayes Classification**: For spam detection.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: To convert text into numerical features.

### Key Features

- **Direct Email Pasting**: Users can paste email content directly into the application.
- **Real-Time Classification**: Provides instant classification of email content.
- **Modern GUI**: Intuitive interface for ease of use.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and preprocessing.
- **tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NLTK**: For text processing and NLP.
