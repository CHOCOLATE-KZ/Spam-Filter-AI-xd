# SpamFilterAI
SpamFilterAI is an upcoming Python project designed to detect spam emails using machine learning. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Naive Bayes classification, the program processes email content and transforms it into valuable data through TF-IDF vectorization. It then classifies emails as spam or not, helping to keep your inbox clean and organized.
